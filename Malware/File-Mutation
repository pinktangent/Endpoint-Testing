This section is useful for testing use case 1) and 2)
1) Static Prevention
2) Dynamic Prevention

For Dynamic Detection and response, malware would "most" likely penetrate your network using non-comoditize malware. This section is useful for mutation of executive files only.

There are many ways to mutate your files. During testing the most effective ways were using packer files or directly modifying the binary:

1) Using a PE packer like mpress.exe or pklite
Packers will typically make the file smaller and will in turn change the hash value of the file.
Traditional signature-based AV can have a difficult time detecting packers unless they sandbox it.
Here are a great resource for understanding packers better : https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Basic-Packers--Easy-As-Pie/

2) Create a hash modifier which essentially adds a byte to the end of the file which in turns changes the hash value

Personally, I found using a packer and/hash modifier worked pretty well, which enabled me to evade software between 5-10%.
I did occasionally find that a variety of PE files were unuseable after they were packed. 
In those cases, the hashmod was more successful.

If you have had success using other methods, please let me know and I will add it to the repo. 
The more input we have, the more effective everyones testing will be.
