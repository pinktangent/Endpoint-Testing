There are many ways to mutate your files. During my testing I did it two ways:
1) Using a packer like mpress.exe - Packers will typically make the file smaller and will in turn change the hash value of the file.
2) Create a hash modifier which essentially adds a byte to the end of the file which in turns changes the hash value

Using a packer and/hash modifier works pretty well. I did personally a vareity files where useable after I used a packer to change their hash value. In those cases, the hashmod was more successful.
