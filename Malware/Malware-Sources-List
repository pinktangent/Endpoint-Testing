Many of the people that I speak to often ask often unsure where to source their malware from.
Here is a list of places I downloaded my malware and get my script testing ideas from. I am sure there are many more places. 
If you want to add to my list, send me a note. I would be happy to add to this list to help benefit others.

Good luck and handle with care.
