In this scenario, I tested 4/5 of the solutions against IE browser exploit MS11-003, available step by step on any good kali intro blog.
I never expected this to work. Ensure your browser is obviously vulnerable otherwise it won't work.

All solutions except one allowed this to run. What makes this scenario interesting is that one might argue that EDR is looking for IoA and therefore creating a reverse shell into windows is not big deal.
Hmmm perhaps, as in my scenario did I do anything which was malicious?!?!?. I mean I exploited a vulnerability in IE.
I then reversed shelled into my vulnerable system and did some quick user reconn.
Then I executed notepad and actually pulled down PS code from a website, which I didnâ€™t capture in this video, but I could re-create if needed.

The system itself did not pick me up, but the monitoring team did after 15 mins of me snooping round, and then found my activity on their dashboard.
1 hour later I re-tried the same exploit and I was prohibited.
You decided for yourself whether this should have been stopped on the onset, I have had many argue the point with me!
