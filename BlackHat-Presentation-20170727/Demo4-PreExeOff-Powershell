Demo 4 demonstrates running 100 pieces of Malware via an extremely simply powershell scripts which just loops through the directory.
What makes this execution so interesting is, previous the same malware was executed via a batch script, everything was either quarantined or blocked.
Same malware, just executed using powershell, the EPP agent is completely blind.
I think we found an accidential zero day in the software code, which we kindly reported and we believe this to be fixed now.
