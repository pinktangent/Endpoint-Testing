3/5 solutions suffered the same fate.
100 pieces of malware which was mutated using two different methods.
Once contaminated with one version of ransomware, the entire system was vulnerable allowing for other malware to be executed hence the double ransomware scenario.

The bigger challenge I saw here, NO SOLUTION learnt. This same scenario was executed successfully 3-4 times over a a series of weeks.
This was when I started to ask my vendors how their ML and Maths Models really worked. Next project I think for me! :)
