  Demo1-20170625-2232-FileShareInfection.mp4
  - This video demonstrates that installing an agent on another endpoint, for example a file share, which is where
  the initiation did not occur does not protect the fileshare.
  - In 5/5 EPP agents installed on a file share, they were not protected when the ransomware connected to it via the network
  and started to encrypt the file share.
  - This scenario is important as most of us know that ransomware inheriantly works as any normal user. It makes its network
  connect and can make CRUD calls. In the case of ransomware where the initial call starts from another endpoint,
  the best you can do in terms of the "protected" file share is detect the behaviour. By the time you get to it, the
  damage is pretty much done.
  - do not let any vendor or marketing talk upsell that your file shares will be protected against ransomware if you plae
  an agent on the file server itself and with no protection on the initiating endpoint.
  - EPIC FAIL!
  - the only way to protect your endpoint is put it in READ-ONLY mode and then your malware can't write. I tested this too
  as logical as it may seem.
