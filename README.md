# Endpoint-Testing
Endpoint Protection (EPP) market is the hot topic of 2017. Many of the EPP vendors have highly skilled people on their teams which can offer you advice on what to do and how to test. But who do you believe, who do you trust!! It can be overwelming as everyone just wants to help.

The purpose of this repository is to provide you with tools that you can use for your own testing. I am not affiliated with any EPP organisation, I am simply an information security professional who recently did a POC for my company. I have taken my learnings and added them to this repo which I hope will provoke ideas and guidance on where to start.

If you are reading this and have other things you think are useful to add or change, please email me or log it as an issue / request.

Enjoy!
