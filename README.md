# Endpoint-Testing
Endpoint Protection (EPP) market is the hot topic of 2017. Many of the EPP vendors have highly skilled people on their teams which can offer you advice on what to do and how to test. But who do you believe, who do you trust!! It can be overwelming as everyone just wants to help.

The purpose of this repository is to provide you with tools that you can use for your own testing. I am not affiliated with any EPP organisation, I am simply an information security professional who recently did a POC using various technologies. I have taken my learnings and added them to this repo which I hope will provoke ideas and guidance on where to start.

At the time of my testing last year, other than a few vendor guides that you were provided with as part of testing, there was nothing really step by step that could help in where to begin. This framework / guide breaks the testing down into 4 stages. 

1) Static Prevention
2) Dynamic Prevention
3) Dynamic Detection and Behaviour Analytics
4) Non-Functional testing - just because it is effective against your functional requirements, is it the right fit for your environment?

If you are reading this and have other things you think are useful to add or change, please email me or log it as an issue / request.

Enjoy!
